Pefect-Centos-Server
====================

The "Pefect Centos Server" Installation Script Project aims to create a full set of installation scripts for centos minimal to auto-install production/development server.

To use this script type at bash:
 git clone https://github.com/ET-CS/Pefect-Centos-Server.git

and run
 setup.sh
 
This script is still in early development mode and shouldn't be started by not expert users.
Do not use this script on your production server, only for testing purposes!
