Perfect-Centos-Server
=====================

The "Perfect Centos Server" Installation Script Project aims to create a full set of installation scripts for centos minimal to auto-install production/development server.

To use this script type at bash:  
1. check you have git installed (yum install git)  
2. git clone https://github.com/ET-CS/Pefect-Centos-Server.git  
3. bash setup.sh
 
This script is still in early development mode and shouldn't be started by not expert users.
Do not use this script on your production server, only for testing purposes!
